# üêß Shell Scripting ‚Äì DevOps Journey (Phase 2)

This repository contains my **handwritten notes** and practical scripts from the **Shell Scripting** phase of my DevOps learning journey.  
The goal of this phase was to build a **strong foundation in Bash scripting**, automate routine tasks, and get hands-on with Linux environments.

## üìö Topics Covered

### 1. Basics of Shell & Bash
- Understanding Shell & Bash
- Shebang (`#!/bin/bash`)
- Executing scripts (`bash script.sh`, `./script.sh`)
- Comments & structure

---

### 2. File and Directory Management
- Commands: `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `touch`, `cp`, `mv`
- Navigating directories & working with relative vs absolute paths
- Using wildcards & globbing (`*`, `?`, `[]`)

---

### 3. Variables, Conditionals & Loops
- Defining and using variables
- Reading user input (`read`)
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`, `case`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `until`)
- Practical examples: checking file existence, iteration over files

---

### 4. Functions & Script Structure
- Declaring and calling functions
- Function parameters & return values
- Structuring scripts into logical blocks
- Reusable scripts and modular approach

---

### 5. Command-line Arguments & Exit Status
- `$0`, `$1`, `$2`, ‚Ä¶ for arguments
- `$#` for argument count
- `$@` and `$*` for all arguments
- `exit` and `$?` for exit codes
- Validating user input in scripts

---

### 6. Text Processing (grep, awk, sed)
- `grep` for searching patterns
- `awk` for text filtering & field extraction
- `sed` for text substitution and inline editing
- Combining commands with pipes for data processing

---

### 7. Scheduling & Automation (Cron Jobs)
- Understanding cron & crontab syntax
- Setting up cron jobs for periodic tasks
- Examples: log rotation, backups, auto-cleanup scripts

---

### 8. File Transfer & Sync
- `scp` for secure file transfer between systems
- `rsync` for efficient file synchronization
- Common flags and examples for automation

---

### 9. Archiving & Compression
- `tar` for archiving multiple files
- `zip` and `gzip` for compression
- Automating backups and storage using shell scripts

---

### 10. Error Handling & Debugging
- Using `set -e`, `set -x`, and `trap`
- Handling errors gracefully in scripts
- Debugging scripts step by step
- Logging outputs for troubleshooting
