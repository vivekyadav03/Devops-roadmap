## üìò Topics Covered

### 1. DNS (Domain Name System)
- Converts domain names into IP addresses.
- Used in Kubernetes (CoreDNS), service discovery, ingress controllers.

### 2. NAT (Network Address Translation)
- Maps private ‚Üî public IPs.
- Used in Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud NAT gateways.

### 3. Ports & Protocols
- TCP vs UDP basics.
- Key ports: 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS).
- Debugging: `netstat`, `ss`, `lsof`.

### 4. DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
- Dynamically assigns IPs in networks.
- Essential in cloud and container environments.

### 5. Proxy Servers
- **Forward Proxy**: Client ‚Üí Proxy ‚Üí Internet  
- **Reverse Proxy**: Internet ‚Üí Proxy ‚Üí Servers  
- Used for caching, load balancing, SSL termination.

### 6. SSL/TLS & HTTPS
- Ensures secure communication.
- Tools: Let‚Äôs Encrypt, AWS ACM.
- Concepts: TLS Handshake, encryption.

### 7. Load Balancing
- Distributes traffic across servers.
- Tools: NGINX, HAProxy, AWS ELB, Kubernetes Ingress.
- Types: L4 (TCP/UDP), L7 (HTTP/HTTPS).

### 8. Firewalls & Security Groups
- Controls inbound/outbound traffic.
- Tools: `iptables`, `ufw`, AWS Security Groups.
- Stateful vs Stateless firewalls.

### 9. IP Addressing & Subnetting
- IPv4 Classes, CIDR, IPv6.
- Used in VPC design, Kubernetes networking.
